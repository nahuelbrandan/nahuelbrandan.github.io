Following the classic computer custom called 'Hello World!'. When a developer begins to learn a new programming 
language, they usually do a _Hello World!_ This is to carry out the simplest possible program, generally to print a 
text on the screen, being fundamental didactically.

In this particular case I am starting with this professional blog, where the idea is to comment on topics in this
beautiful area and give solutions to problems, as well as tell interesting stories.

let's see what comes out!
