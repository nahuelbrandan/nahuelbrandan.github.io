## Development

Throughout the development process we work **simulating a real development environment**, creating *tickets* and 
assigning them among the members.

For the implementation of each *ticket* a specific *git brach* was made, sending a
*pull request* when it is complete, which is validated by the rest of the members, so that once it is approved
integrate it to the general branch.
