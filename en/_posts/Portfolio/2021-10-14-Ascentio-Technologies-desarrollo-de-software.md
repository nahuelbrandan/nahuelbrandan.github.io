[Ascentio Technologies](https://www.ascentio.com.ar/) is an Argentinean technological company oriented to the 
design, development and operation of complex high-availability systems for the **aerospace sector**.

I'm excited to be able to work here since August/2021 as a software developer, on challenging projects,
in a company with a professional culture and surrounded by very experienced people.

## Project: Sabia-Mar

[Sabia-Mar](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/ciencia/conae/misiones-espaciales/sabia-mar) is a satellite mission,
with advanced technology for the study of the sea and the ocean, with the aim of
provide valuable knowledge for the care of maritime resources and with an impact on the sectors
scientific and productive. It is scheduled to launch in 2023.

I work as a backend software developer in Python, **making contributions to different modules
communication and flight planning of the satellite**. Developing functionalities and automated tests corresponding.

In addition, organizing with Scrum methodologies, in a team of a dozen people.

### Reflection

I consider that the projects that exist are very challenging on a technical level, and when working with satellites,
which are very critical systems, requires higher quality standards.
